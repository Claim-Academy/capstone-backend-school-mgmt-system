# School Management System

## Overview

This is a school management system that allows you to manage students, teachers, and classes. It is a simple system that allows you to add, edit, and delete students, teachers, and classes. It also allows you to assign students to classes and assign teachers to classes.

It provides an alternative to the traditional paper-based systems or spreadsheets that is used in many schools. It is a simple system that is easy to use and is designed to be used by teachers and administrators.

It doesn't try to do too much by being a full-blown LMS, but just focuses on the core functionality of managing students, teachers, and classes, specifically attendance as this is a common metric for various financial aids and funding.

This concept is inspired by the very nice spreadsheet set up by Elias here at Claim Academy and takes it a step further by adding a simple web interface to it.

## Data Sample and Schema

I am favoring an embedded document approach for this project. This is because the data is highly relational and it is easier to manage the data this way. It also makes it easier to query the data. This is the **general** approach that is used in MongoDB for small data sets.

We have two collections: `classes` and `teachers`. Teachers are duplicated in the classes. As this is not SQL, duplicated data in MongoDB is still favored over using `$lookup` and **joins.**

### Sample Data

#### Class Collection

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Full-stack Web Development",
    "description": "This is a full-stack web development class.",
    "teacher": {
      "name": "Elias",
      "email": "elias@claimacademystl.com"
      "password": "password"
    },
    "students": [
      {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "attendance": [
          {
            "date": "2020-01-01",
            "present": "Left Early"
          },
          {
            "date": "2020-01-02",
            "present": "Present"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "Jane Doe",
        "attendance": [
          {
            "date": "2020-01-01",
            "present": "Late"
          },
          {
            "date": "2020-01-02",
            "present": "Excused Absence"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "Jim Doe",
        "attendance": [
          {
            "date": "2020-01-01",
            "present": "Late"
          },
          {
            "date": "2020-01-02",
            "present": "Unexcused Absence"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

#### Teachers Collection

```json
[{
      "name": "Elias",
      "email": "elias@claimacademystl.com"
      "password": "password"
    },
    {
      "name": "Manav",
      "email: "manavm@visionwebsoft.com",
      "password: "JSisAwesome"
      }
]
```

### Mongoose Schema

```js
const AttendanceSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  date: { type: String, required: true },
  present: { type: String, required: true }
});

const StudentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  attendance: [AttendanceSchema]
});

const TeacherSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
});

const ClassSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  description: { type: String, required: true },
  teacher: TeacherSchema,
  students: [StudentSchema]
});```
